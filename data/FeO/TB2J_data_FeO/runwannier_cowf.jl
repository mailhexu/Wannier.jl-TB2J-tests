Now let's disentangle with spin overlap constraint.
Here `位s` is the Lagrange multiplier for the constraint.
=#
位s = 100.0
U_up, U_dn = disentangle(model, 位s;max_iter=400 );
#=
The resulting spin-up and spin-down WFs have very similar centers and spreads,
however, their centers drift from the original positions which were centered
on atoms.

omega(model, U_up, U_dn, 位s)

# position operator
pos_up = Wannier.TBPosition(model_up, gauges=U_up)
pos_dn = Wannier.TBPosition(model_dn, gauges=U_dn)

# Hamiltonian
ham_up = Wannier.TBHamiltonian(model_up, U_up)
ham_dn = Wannier.TBHamiltonian(model_dn, U_dn)

# write to tb files
Wannier.write_w90_tb("up/FeO_up", ham_up, pos_up)
Wannier.write_w90_tb("dn/FeO_down", ham_dn, pos_dn)
